## How to run the program ?

1- Find your User-Agent (You find it under network traffic using f12).

2- Change the User-Agent field in "entrapeer.py" with your own User-Agent. 

(For me it was "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0").

3- Run the "entrapeer.py".
